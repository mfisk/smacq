			SMACQ BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

On supported systems (Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS/X + Fink), simply run "make" 
to build.  If you do not have all of the prerequisits (see below), you 
may encounter an error.

Global configuration options are in config.mk.  The primary reason to edit
this file is to enable/disable debugging options.

All binary and platform-specific files are placed in platform directories 
in the "build" subdirectory.  After running "make" once from the top-level
directory of the source tree, usable Makefiles will exist in each
subdirectory of the build tree.  You may use these Makefiles to rebuild
portions of the tree.

Optional functionality:
-----------------------

The packet data-type can use Ethereal's EPAN system for decoding a 
multitude of protocols.  This optional functionality can be included 
using the following syntax:
	make clean
	make WITH=ethereal

Other Operating Systems:
------------------------
The SMACQ build procedure depends on GNU libtool and GNU Make.
By installing the equivalent of the packages listed for the above
operating systems, and passing the correct arguments to Make, you
should be able to build SMACQ.  Contributions of documentation for 
building on other operating systems would be appreciated.
The misc/config-env script is used to generate the per-platform
config.mk file placed in each platform directory.

MacOS/X - Fink:
----------------
Run the following command to install the Fink packages require to compile
and execute this package:
	apt-get install \
		dlcompat zlib glib2-dev libpcap libpcap-shlibs \
		libtool groff #python  

FreeBSD:

		   	    MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

To force the regeneration of intermediate files from SGML, Bison, and Flex run 
the following command:
	make reallyclean

To run the regression tests:
	make test

To only see warning output (less verbose):
