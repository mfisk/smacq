Resolve:
	Join needs where information to determine type of join
	Pcaplive and Disarm modules could take advantage of where information

	Should modules volunteer to take care of where info (and then delegate if necessary)?

	How do you specify different types of joins?

getfield():
	Who allocates, who frees?


modules/intervals.c:
	BUG: Doesn't do well when fields change in size and type.
	Fix: Need to save field vectors rather than bytearray

Scheduler:
	"pcapfile \| head 100 \| intervals"  doesn't result in the produce or shutdown calls to intervals being called.
	What is head returning, or what is the scheduler doing wrong?
