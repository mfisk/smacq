			SMACQ BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Quick & Dirty:
--------------
Type "make".

This will make a build directory and a subdirectory for the platform
you are building in.  In that directory, configure will be run and SMACQ
will be built.

Why not run ./configure like a normal package?
----------------------------------------------
You can, but the results will be built in the source tree (as you
probably expect).  This prevents you from using the same directory 
tree to build on multiple platforms.  We automate the "vpath trick" 
so you don't have to.

How do I pass configure options?
--------------------------------
Set them in the CONFIG environment variable before running make:
	CONFIG="--with-ethereal" make
	CONFIG="--enable-debug" make
	CONFIG="--enable-profile --enable-debug" make

Supported Platforms:
--------------------
Debian GNU/Linux is the development platform.  SMACQ has been built
on Linux, FreeBSD, and MacOS/X + Fink.  

Optional functionality:
-----------------------
The packet data-type can use Ethereal's EPAN system for decoding a 
multitude of protocols.  This optional functionality can be included 
using the following syntax:
	rm -Rf build 
	CONFIG="--with-ethereal" make 

Troubleshooting:
----------------
If you have any problems with the build procedure, you may have gotten
a package with some out of date files.  Type "make bootstrap" and try
again.  Note that you will neet autoconf, automake, libtool, etc. installed
in order to "make bootstrap".

			PREREQUISITES

Debian GNU/Linux:
-----------------
Run the following command to install the Debian packages require to compile
and execute this package:
	apt-get install \
		g++ gcc \
		zlib1g zlib1g-dev \
		libglib2.0 libglib2.0-dev \
		libpcap0 libpcap-dev \
		libgda-dev gda-sqlite \
		libtool groff #python2.2-dev 

Red Hat Linux:
--------------
The following packages are required:
	glib2-devel
	...

MacOS/X - Fink:
----------------
Run the following command to install the Fink packages require to compile
and execute this package:
	apt-get install \
		pkgconfig dlcompat zlib glib2-dev libpcap libpcap-shlibs \
		libtool groff #python  

FreeBSD:
--------
Run the following commands to install the necessary packages:
	pkg_add -r gmake libtool bison
	make -C /usr/ports/devel/glib20 install

=============================================================================
		   	    MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

To force the regeneration of intermediate files from SGML, Bison, and Flex run 
the following command:
	make reallyclean

To run the regression tests:
	make test

To only see warning output (less verbose):
	make warn

				BUGS

The grammer builds but doesn't seem to work correctly with Bison 1.35.  
Bison 1.75 does work
