			SMACQ BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Quick & Dirty:
--------------
Type "make".  If everything works, you will have a "bin/smacqq" executable.

Supported Platforms:
--------------------
Debian GNU/Linux and MacOS/X + Fink are the primary development platforms.  
SMACQ has also been built on FreeBSD and various buggy versions of RedHat.
GCC 3.3 and 4.0 are the compilers we usually use.

Packaging:
----------
We suggest using epm from http://www.easysw.com/epm/ to build RPM, Debian, 
BSD, MacOS/X, Solaris, and other packages.  A smacq.list file is included 
for those purposes.  An RPM spec file is also included, but may not be 
maintained in the future.

Optional functionality:
-----------------------
SMACQ can build with the following optional functionality:

- Python integration
	The "python" module allows you to write SMACQ modules in Python
	instead of C++.  This module is automatically built if Python
	libraries are detected.

- libgda database integration
	This provides the "sqlinsert" module that allows you to insert
	data into various databases (SQLlite, MySQL, Postgres, etc.).
	configure automatically builds in libgda support if the
	appropriate libraries are installed on your system:
		Debian: libgda-4.0-dev 

- Ethereal integration
	The packet data-type can use Ethereal's EPAN system for decoding a 
	multitude of protocols.  This optional functionality can be included 
	using the "--with-ethereal" configure option and specifying the path
	to an ethereal source tree that has already been built..
