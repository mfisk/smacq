			SMACQ BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

On supported systems (Linux, MacOS/X + Fink), simply run "make" to build.
If you do not have all of the prerequisits (see below), you may encounter
an error.

Other Operating Systems:
------------------------
The SMACQ build procedure depends on GNU libtool and GNU Make.
By installing the equivalent of the packages listed for the above
operating systems, and passing the correct arguments to Make, you
should be able to build SMACQ.  Contributions of documentation for 
building on other operating systems would be appreciated.
