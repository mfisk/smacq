PATRICIA
--------
The PATRICIA implementation in the patricia subdirectory is extracted
from Dave Plonka's Net::Patricia package (released under the GPL) for
perl which in turn extracted it from MRT's patricia code from
radix.[ch], which was worked on by Masaki Hirabaru and Craig Labovitz.
For more info on MRT see: http://www.mrtd.net/.   The MRT patricia code 
owes some heritage to GateD's radix code, which in turn owes something 
to the BSD kernel.  The MRT Copyright is as follows:
