modules/intervals.c:
	BUG: Doesn't do well when fields change in size and type.
	Fix: Need to save field vectors rather than bytearray

Scheduler:
	"pcapfile \| head 100 \| intervals"  doesn't result in the produce or shutdown calls to intervals being called.
	What is head returning, or what is the scheduler doing wrong?
