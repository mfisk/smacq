Bugs:
	- "not function()" in booleans
	- define.test not sufficiently optimized, misses some of the extra queries

Optimizations:
	- remove invariants from join test
	- do invariant tests before streamalias
	- merge_tails would be faster if a GraphSet described both the roots (heads) and leaves (tails) of the GraphSet.
	- merge groupby graphs when grouping on the same thing
	- make sure expr() is annotation func
	- remove [] and expressions from parser
	- cast() module
	- FileHandle type and class
	- file() module that produces FileHandle objects
	- DTS RPC (GasNet Active Messages)

Looking for volunteers:
	- Regex parsing for tabularinput
	- scanf parsing for tabularinput
	- printf-style formats for print module
	- socket read (ala netcat) for tabularinput
	- Make all vectorizing occur through a module callback that
		accepts or rejects an additional set of arguments
	- Module to read, write, increment DB3 files
	- Add ldapsearch() module
